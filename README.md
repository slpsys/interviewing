# Interviewing

This shit is _hard_.

## First Principles

Some of these are also reaped from pinned items in the [Rands Leadership Slack](http://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/).

#### Reverse Interviewing

* [14 ideas for what to say when a job interviewer asks “any questions for me?”](https://rooting-for-you.cenedella.com/14-ideas-for-what-to-say-when-a-job-interviewer-asks-any-questions-for-me-31b0ce03881a#.kl62xrrj6)
* [Questions I'm Asking in Interviews](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/)

### Sample Questions

**N.B.**: Do not actually use these, and _certainly_ do not just print them out and read off of them, heads down, in an interview or phone screen. I'm listing these because merely reading might be the spark that ignites a more interesting, or at least more personally-relevant, question.

Also, some of these are fairly old, some of these are more geared toward senior engineers, and some of these are may not be relevant, in any way, to what you do. Many of them also are gold mines containing links to _other great posts_. You could probably spend a day noodling around.
